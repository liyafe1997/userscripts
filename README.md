# 📜 UserScripts

The userscript collection I wrote makes life easier and better. I use the browser extension [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net) to run and manage userscripts. You need to install it first to use userscript.

## 📖 Usage

### Install on GreasyFork

Visit my userscript list on the GreasyFork website [here](https://greasyfork.org/users/1306283-tientq64).

### Install on GitHub

Each folder in the [scripts](./scripts) folder contains a `script.user.js` file, which contains the script code. Click on that file, then click `Raw` button to install it.
