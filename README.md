# 📜 UserScripts

List of userscripts I wrote. I use the browser extension [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) to run and manage userscripts. You can install it to use my userscripts. If not, open Console (press `Ctrl+Shift+J`), copy the code, paste and run it.

## 📖 Usage

Each folder in the `scripts` folder contains a `script.user.js` file, which contains the script code. Click on that file, then click `Raw` button to install it if you use TamperMonkey. Otherwise, instead of clicking the `Raw` button, click the `Copy raw file` button next to it to copy the code.
